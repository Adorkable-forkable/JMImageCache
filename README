My own VERY quick attempt at extracting the way I do remote image caching from one of my iOS projects.                                                         

There are three states an image can be in:
	* Cached In Memory
	* Cached On Disk
	* Not Cached
	
If an image is requested from cache, and it has never been cached, it is downloaded, stored on disk, put into memory and returned via delegate callback.

If an image is requested from cache, and it has been cached, but hasn't been seen this session, it is read from disk, brought into memory and returned.

If an image is request from cache, and it has been cached and it is already in memory, it is simply returned.

The code is guaranteed to be pretty or bug free, but it works :)
